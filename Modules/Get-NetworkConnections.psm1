.SYNOPSIS
    Collects information about active network connections on the system.
    
.DESCRIPTION
    Get-NetworkConnections provides detailed information about active TCP and UDP
    connections, their associated processes, and remote endpoints. It identifies
    potentially suspicious connections based on destination IP, port, or process
    behavior to help detect unauthorized network activity.
    
.EXAMPLE
    $networkConnectionsFile = Get-NetworkConnections
    
.OUTPUTS
    String. The path to the CSV file containing network connection data
